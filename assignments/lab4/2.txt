# 6. Write a Bash script that prompts the user to provide a filename and a word to search for.
# The script should first check if the file exists and then count the number of lines in the
# . If the file contains more than n lines, it should search for the word in the file and
 the line numbers where the word appears. If the file contains n or fewer lines, the
# script should display a message indicating that the search will not be performed.
