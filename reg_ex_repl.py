# Okay, you want to perform the replacements \( -> $ and \) -> $ only outside of code blocks delimited by triple backticks (```).

# The best way to handle this kind of contextual replacement is to use re.sub with a callback function. The idea is to create a regular expression that matches either a code block or the patterns you want to replace. The callback function then inspects the match object to see which part matched and decides what to return.

# Here's how you can do it:

import re

def replace_math_delimiters_outside_code(text):
    """
    Replaces \( with $ and \) with $ only outside of ```...``` code blocks.
    """

    def replacer(match):
        # Check which group matched
        code_block = match.group(1)
        open_math = match.group(2)
        close_math = match.group(3)

        if code_block:
            # If it's a code block (group 1), return it unchanged
            return code_block
        elif open_math:
            # If it's the opening math delimiter (group 2), replace it with $
            return "$"
        elif close_math:
            # If it's the closing math delimiter (group 3), replace it with $
            return "$"
        else:
            # This case should not be reached with the given pattern,
            # but it's good practice to handle it.
            return match.group(0) # Return the original match if unsure

    # Regex explanation:
    # (```.*?```) : Group 1: Match a complete code block.
    #               - ```: Matches the opening triple backticks.
    #               - .*?: Matches any character (including newline due to re.DOTALL)
    #                      zero or more times, non-greedily.
    #               - ```: Matches the closing triple backticks.
    # |           : OR
    # (\\\(\s*)   : Group 2: Match the opening LaTeX math delimiter.
    #               - \\\( : Matches literal characters '\('.
    #               - \s*  : Matches zero or more whitespace characters.
    # |           : OR
    # (\s*\\\))   : Group 3: Match the closing LaTeX math delimiter.
    #               - \s*  : Matches zero or more whitespace characters.
    #               - \\\) : Matches literal characters '\)'.
    #
    # We use re.DOTALL so that '.' in the code block pattern matches newline characters.
    pattern = r"(```.*?```)|(\\\(\s*)|(\s*\\\))"

    modified_text = re.sub(pattern, replacer, text, flags=re.DOTALL)
    return modified_text

# **Explanation:**

# 1.  **`replace_math_delimiters_outside_code(text)` function:** Encapsulates the logic.
# 2.  **`replacer(match)` callback function:** This function is called for every match found by `re.sub`.
#     *   It inspects `match.group(1)`, `match.group(2)`, and `match.group(3)`.
#     *   If `match.group(1)` is not `None`, it means a code block was matched. The function returns the matched code block (`code_block`) unchanged.
#     *   If `match.group(2)` is not `None`, it means `\(` was matched *outside* a code block. The function returns `$`.
#     *   If `match.group(3)` is not `None`, it means `\)` was matched *outside* a code block. The function returns `$`.
# 3.  **`pattern`:** The regex combines three possibilities using the `|` (OR) operator:
#     *   `(```.*?```)`: Captures a full code block into group 1. The `.*?` is non-greedy to handle multiple code blocks correctly.
#     *   `(\\\(\s*)`: Captures the opening math delimiter (`\( ` possibly followed by space) into group 2.
#     *   `(\s*\\\))`: Captures the closing math delimiter (possibly preceded by space ` \)`) into group 3.
# 4.  **`re.sub(pattern, replacer, text, flags=re.DOTALL)`:**
#     *   Applies the `pattern` to the `text`.
#     *   For each match, it calls the `replacer` function.
#     *   `flags=re.DOTALL` is crucial so that the `.` in `.*?` can match newline characters within the code blocks.

# This approach correctly identifies the context (inside or outside a code block) before deciding whether to perform the replacement.
